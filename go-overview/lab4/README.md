## Lab 4: Functions in Go

### Objective
Learn to define and use functions in Go, including functions with single and multiple return values, handling errors, and understanding pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.


1. **Create a Function with a Single Return Value**
  - Write a function `Subtract` that takes two integers and returns their difference.

2. **Create a Function that Finds the Maximum Value in a Slice and Returns an Error**
  - Write a function MaxInSlice that takes a slice of int

3. **Create a Function to Modify a Value (Pass-by-Value)**
  - Write a function `DoubleValue` that takes an integer and returns its double.

4. **Create a Function to Modify a Value (Pass-by-Reference)**
  - Write a function `DoubleValueInPlace` that takes a pointer to an integer and doubles its value.
